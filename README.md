## School finder system
According to a 2021 survey, many parents often struggle finding the right school for their children that meets all their needs. In this project I built a recommender system using XGBoost classifier and a user interface to satisfy practicality and provide a seamless user experience. (more description to follow soon)

## Predicting thoracic disorders from chest X-ray images
Clinical diagnosis still remains challenging to this day. Human error can hinder clinical interpretations due to fatigue, reader inexperience etc. In this project, I built a deep learning classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a VGG-19 model assisting radiologists in making accurate decisions.

## Currency exchange system
In this project, I fetched latest exhange rates using REST APIs and stored them in a PostgreSQL database, hosted on AWS RDB. On this, I provided a service that converts an amount from source currency to target currency. Additionally, I added a caching layer to imprpve performance for when the database encounters heavy traffic.

## Identifying the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
In 2020, COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in England and Wales, accounting for 12.1% of all deaths. In this project using the UK BioBank data, I identified participants who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and explored post-infection hospitalisation and death records summarizing the most common diagnosis. I then compared changes in the weighting of these diagnosis and changes in risk factors before and after the outbreak.

## Clinical and genetic predictors of breast cancer survival
My motivation behind this project was to identify the best way to detect and treat breast cancer, in order to improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients. Utilising Kaplan Meier to estimate survival following diagnosis, identifying the most important clinical prognostic indicators using cox regression and answering the critical questions such as "Is type of treatment associated with breast cancer survival" using multiple cox regression model, chi-squared test, global schoenfeld test to satisfy the proportional hazards assumption.

## Identifying subtypes of early and late onset asthma & the corresponding characteristics
8 million people in the UK have asthma with age playing an important role in asthma onset. In this project, I identified the risk factors and comorbidity characteristics of early and late onset of asthma as well as distinguishable asthma subtypes using LASSO, K-prototype clustering (with PCA) and random forest for sensitivity analysis.

### 2. Epidemiology and Lifestyle Determinants of High Blood Pressure in the USA
High blood pressure is a major issue in the USA. Nearly 50% of adults have hypertension. Research is important to establish relationships between certain factors and hypertension, allowing epidemiologists to provide advice on possible ways to mitigate the issue.
