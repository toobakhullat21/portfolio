## Predicting thoracic disorders from chest X-ray images
Clinical diagnosis still remains challenging to this day. Human error can hinder clinical interpretations due to fatigue, reader inexperience etc. In this project, I built a deep learning classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a VGG-19 model assisting radiologists in making accurate interpretations.

### 2. Epidemiology and Lifestyle Determinants of High Blood Pressure in the USA
High blood pressure is a major issue in the USA. Nearly 50% of adults have hypertension. Research is important to establish relationships between certain factors and hypertension, allowing epidemiologists to provide advice on possible ways to mitigate the issue.
